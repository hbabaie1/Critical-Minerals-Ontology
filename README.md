# Critical-Minerals-Ontology
CMO (Critical Minerals Ontology) is an ontology of the critical minerals system based on the CMMI's Deposit Classification Scheme. 
The Jupyter notebooks (Python code) for the query system are available upon request from hbabaie@gsu.edu. Users who intend to adopt the query system need to download the publicly available Owlready2 and Jupyter Notebook for accessing the ontology with the Python language. Users who intend to extend and reuse the CMO ontology can download the latest versions of the ontology (CMO.owl) from GitHub (here). If you requested the the critical minerals Jupyter notebook (CMO.ipynb) from hbabaie@gsu.edu, save it along with the CMO.owl file in the Owlready2 folder. The CMO must be stored in the CCO master folder. The query system can then be run on the userâ€™s computer (localhost) by opening the Jupyter notebook which references the ontology and runs the query system.
